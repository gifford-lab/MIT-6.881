    <h2 class="module-header">MIT 6.881/20.S948    Machine Learning Based Therapeutic Design    3-0-3 (G)</h2>


    <h2 class="module-header">Course description</h2>
    <p>Advanced seminar on computational methods in the design and analysis of human therapeutics, including vaccines,  small molecules, biologics, cell based therapies, and synthetic biology approaches. Lectures will present recent results on computational methods on vaccine design, molecular design and optimization drawing upon advances in machine learning.  Recitations will include presentations by students on recent research results related to the computational design of therapeutics and efficacy. Topics include protein design, antibody optimization, vaccine design, small molecule design and characterization, and the engineering of viruses and cell lines for therapeutic effect. Experts from industry and faculty will present their views of the promise of computational approaches, what is working, and what is needed.
